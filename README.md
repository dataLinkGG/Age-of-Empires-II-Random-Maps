# Age of Empires II Random Maps Project

## Overview

This is an informal project aimed at just playing around with random map generation scripts from Age of Empires II HD, a classic real-time strategy game.

1. **Installation**:

If you installed Age of Empires II HD Edition through Steam:

* Steam Library: Open your Steam client and go to your "Library."
* Right-click on "Age of Empires II: HD Edition" in your library and select "Properties."
* Local Files: In the "Properties" window, navigate to the "Local Files" tab, and click on "Browse Local Files." This will open the game's installation directory.
* Scenario or RM Folder: In the installation directory, look for a folder named "Scenario" or "RM." This is where the random map scripts are typically stored.
